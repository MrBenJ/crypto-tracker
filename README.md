Cryptocurrency Tracking SPA
===========================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/MrBenJ/crypto-tracker.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Bootstrapped with my own boilerplate, [Not Another React Boilerplate](https://www.github.com/MrBenJ/generator-not-another-react-boilerplate).


# Intro
Just a small little cryptocurrency tracker.
NOTE: I did not realize this until late in development, but the data from the current API I'm using along with the actual data itself is not up to date, and is from October of last year. Do not use this if you're really trying to check the price of cryptocurrencies!
